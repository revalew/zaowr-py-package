"""
This package provides tools and utilities for camera calibration, stereo calibration,
image processing, and related operations.

Modules:

- `calibration`: Tools for camera and stereo calibration.

- `content_loaders`: Functions to load and validate calibration data from files and load the ground truth `.pgm` file or save the disparity map.

- `custom_exceptions`: Custom exceptions for error handling.

- `image_processing`: Utilities for image rectification, distortion removal and disparity map calculation and color difference map calculation.

- `tools`: Additional tools, such as ArUco dictionary identification, performance measurement or image cropping.
