"""
This package provides tools and utilities for camera calibration, stereo calibration,
image processing, calculation of disparity/depth maps, calculation of optical flow and related operations.

Modules:

- `calibration`: Tools for single and stereo camera calibration.

- `content_loaders`: Functions to load and validate calibration data from files, load the ground truth `.pgm` or `.pfm` file,  save the disparity map, write a .ply file and load depth map calibration.

- `custom_exceptions`: Custom exceptions for error handling.

- `image_processing`: Utilities for image rectification, distortion removal, disparity map calculation, color difference map calculation, disparity map comparison, depth map conversion (disparity to depth), disparity map normalization, depth map normalization, depth map to disparity map conversion, depth map decoding, color point cloud creation.

- `optical_flow`: Tools to calculate the Optical Flow using **Sparse** (Shi-Tomasi corner detection and Lucas-Kanade optical flow) and **Dense** (Farneback optical flow) Optical Flow** algorithms. Tool to list available camera ports and the ones that are working (and can be used as a feed fot the optical flow algorithms).

- `tools`: Additional tools, such as ArUco dictionary identification, performance measurement, image cropping, image display using matplotlib, get points form photo using mouse click (pixel coordinates), get map value for points (e.g. disparity, depth).
