"""
The `optical_flow` module provides functions for computing optical flow using different algorithms.

Functions:

- `list_camera_ports_available`: Lists available camera ports and the ones that are working.

- `read_images_from_folder`: Reads images from a folder and sorts them alphabetically.

- `sparse_optical_flow`: Calculates sparse optical flow using Shi-Tomasi corner detection and Lucas-Kanade optical flow.

- `dense_optical_flow`: Calculates dense optical flow using Farneback optical flow algorithm.

Usage:
    - Use this module to perform optical flow computation.
